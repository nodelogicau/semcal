# Semantic Calendaring

Semantic Calendaring explores the intersection of the Semantic Web with calendaring standards.

## Overview

Calendaring standards such as iCalendar have increasing support for Semantic Web concepts via updated and extensions to
the original specifications.

This enables calendaring software to participate in interoperability initiatives designed
for the Web. Some of these initiatives include:

* Web Linking
* Linked Data (e.g. JSON-LD, RDFa, etc.)
* Microformats
* WebSub
* WebMention
* Linked Data Notifications

In applying these standards natively to a calendaring context, the Semantic Web provides support for a powerful graph
of calendaring information.
