Whilst catering to the lowest common denominator has ensured maximum compatibility across calendaring clients, it has meant that simple features such as rich content have struggled to gain traction.</p> <p>Whilst the introduction of the <code>STYLED-DESCRIPTION</code> property was intended to solve the issue of rich content support, it's implementation has been slow due to unclear guidelines on how it should be used.</p> <p>Semcal proposes the following principles around using rich content in semantic calendar objects:</p> <ol> <li>Every semantic calendar object SHOULD include a <code>STYLED-DESCRIPTION</code> property of content type <code>text/html</code>. This property SHOULD also    be derived content (indicated via the <code>DERIVED=TRUE</code> parameter) to promote consistency of HTML styling and formatting.</li> <li>A semantic calendar object SHOULD only be maintained via a single calendar user agent (CUA). This is to ensure that the rich content    in each <code>STYLED-DESCRIPTION</code> property is consistent with the rest of the object (e.g. we explicitly want to avoid updating the    <code>DESCRIPTION</code> property without updating the corresponding <code>STYLED-DESCRIPTION</code>. CUAs that don't support semantic calendaring SHOULD    remove any <code>STYLED-DESCRIPTION</code> properties if they update the <code>DESCRIPTION</code> to avoid propogating inconsistent data.</li> <li>A semantic calendar object SHOULD include a <code>LINK</code> property referring to a URL for editing/maintaining the object. This is specified    via the <code>LINKREL=edit</code> parameter, which should be incorporated into an update function in supporting CUAs. This is to support simultaneous    access to a calendar object (e.g. via CalDAV) using multiple clients.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#metadata","title":"Metadata","text":"<p>Templates are often used to apply sensible defaults and semantic metadata when creating new events and other objects. iCalendar has recently introduced two properties supporting semantic metadata: <code>CONCEPT</code> and <code>STRUCTURED-DATA</code>. Using <code>CONCEPT</code> we are able to provide more granular type information that allows CUAs to recognise and process objects differently.</p> <p><code>STRUCTURED-DATA</code> allows us to capture or generate additional data formats beyond the scope of the iCalendar specification. We can embed agreed formats (such as JSON-LD) to enhance CUAs' interoperability. </p> <p>The following principles for semantic data are proposed by semcal:</p> <ol> <li>Each semantic calendar object MUST include a <code>CONCEPT</code> property. This is used to specify the type of event, to-do, journal, etc.    represented by the calendar object. An example of a type could be a Meeting event, a Service Request to-do, or a Metric journal.    By specifying type information a richer interaction is facilitated between calendar user agents. NOTE: \"vanilla\" typing MUST also    be supported by providing types that represent event, to-do, journal, etc. without further specificity.</li> <li>A semantic calendar object SHOULD include linked data via the <code>STRUCTURED-DATA</code> property. Linked data is typically defined via    JSON-LD or RDFa formats (JSON and XML respectively), and allows for interactions with non-calendaring systems. For example, a    Web search engine may be able to parse the <code>STRUCTURED-DATA</code> property of semantic calendar objects in order to index the object    for improved search results.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#linking","title":"Linking","text":"<p>The <code>LINK</code> property allows for additional linking between semantic calendar objects to support construction of a  larger semantic graph.</p> <p>The following semcal principles demonstrate additional linking relationships:</p> <ol> <li>For recurring events, individual occurrences may be customized with additional information specifically for that instance.    With semcal, when customising such an instance the CUA SHOULD include a <code>LINK</code> property referring to the previous instance    via the <code>LINKREL=prev</code> parameter.</li> <li>Semantic calendaring objects SHOULD include authoring information via one or more <code>LINK</code> properties with a <code>LINKREL=author</code>    parameter.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"#publishing","title":"Publishing","text":"<p>Whilst many calendaring clients support subscribing to remote calendars, the reality is that most published events are statically imported to internal calendars either via Web links or email attachments.</p> <p>The following principles propose how to support subscriptions for updating individual events:</p> <ol> <li>A CUA supporting semantic calendar SHOULD create a topic named from the event <code>UID</code> value for each published event via a WebSub    hub. This hub is to be linked in the event via a <code>LINK</code> with <code>LINKREL=hub</code>. A recipient CUA SHOULD check for such <code>LINK</code>    properties and automatically subscribe to the topic corresponding to the event <code>UID</code>. The subscription duration should be at    least until the event has passed, but typically with an additional grace period to allow for updates including media related    to the event.</li> <li>Optionally, a CUA may choose to support reciprocal links for specific events via the Webmention standard. To support reciprocal    links a semantic calendar object MUST include a <code>LINK</code> property referring to a callback URL for posting a new link. This    property is identified via the <code>LINKREL=webmention</code> parameter. When creating new calendar objects that refer to another, CUAs    may check for a Webmention link in the related object and POST a link to the new event. The receiving CUA may optionally    require approval prior to updating the original event with the new link, but once approved would add a new <code>LINK</code> property    for the URL using the <code>LINKREL=replies</code> parameter.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"linking-and-publishing/","title":"A brief history of calendaring","text":""},{"location":"linking-and-publishing/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<ul> <li>Linking and publishing are two important functions in calendaring</li> <li>Historically iCalendar has supported \"linking\" events, etc. with organizers, attendees, and related events, etc.</li> <li>Publishing via email and HTTP is well-supported</li> <li>Recent specifications provide much richer linking to participants, locations, resources, and anything addressable via URI</li> <li> <p>These additional linking capabilities allow for more publishing alternatives, that in-turn provide greater efficiency and consistency for linked data</p> </li> <li> <p>Two alternatives to enriching calendar data are to embed or link to more metadata</p> </li> <li>For open standards, consensus on complex structures is difficult to obtain, making embedding metadata more difficult </li> <li>Links can be used in a backwards-compatible way, such that they may be ignored where they are not supported</li> <li>Linked data is often represented as a knowledge graph, with the ability to traverse the graph in any direction (requires reciprocal links*)</li> <li>The graphs representing events as implemented today by most vendors is very small compared to the potential supported by today's standards</li> <li> <p>The introduction of more linked data is also likely to increase frequency of updates, as those links are updated</p> </li> <li> <p>For frequent, discrete changes to calendar data, email notifications are perhaps not the most efficient or desirable publishing mechanism</p> </li> <li>WebSub provides a means to deliver frequent and irregular changes without email or HTTP polling</li> </ul>"},{"location":"linking-and-publishing/#ical4j","title":"iCal4j","text":"<ul> <li>Core library supports parsing, object model, validation, etc.</li> <li>vCard provides parsing and object model for vCard</li> <li>Extensions builds on object models</li> <li>Serializer converts object model to other formats, including jCal and xCal</li> <li>Connector explores persistence, including CalDAV</li> <li>Integration supports iCalendar transports, including email</li> <li>Template provides creation patterns for common data types</li> <li>Command implements common patterns for data processing, including validation and serialization</li> </ul> <p>With Open Source, we have the luxury of exploring not just the current state of calendaring, but also what the future may look like.</p>"},{"location":"linking-and-publishing/#icalendar-link","title":"iCalendar LINK","text":"<ul> <li>The LINK property introduces an important concept from the Semantic Web, the ability to connect data to produce knowledge graphs</li> <li>RELATED-TO provides some support for connections, but was limited in scope</li> <li>Through links to external content we can enrich data without the burden of bloated metadata</li> <li>Links also offer good support for backwards compatibility, in that LINK properties are ignored where they aren't supported</li> </ul> <p>Linking allows us not only to extend the metadata of an object, but also to introduce ways to distribute and discover new data.</p>"},{"location":"linking-and-publishing/#websub","title":"WebSub","text":"<ul> <li>WebSub is a publish/subscribe model whereby data consumers can subscribe to a topic and receive updates in near real time</li> <li>WebSub is good for distributing frequent (or infrequent) updates to a large number of subscribers</li> <li>Compared to polling, WebSub becomes increasingly more efficient as the number of subscribers grow and/or the frequency of polling increases</li> <li>Calendar polling works today due to low frequency typical of most user agents.
