# Semantic Calendaring - Linking

The iCalendar `LINK` property was recently ratified as a standard way of linking iCalendar objects with each other
or with externally addressable content. Here we identify a subset of potentially useful types of linking
extracted from the list of registered link relations.

## Overview

Linking iCalendar objects facilitates construction of a semantic graph incorporating both iCalendar and other
web resources.

Link types include:

* Alternate
* Author
* Bookmark
* Copyright
* Edit
* External
* Help
* Hub
* Icon
* License
* Next
* Prev
* Related
* Replies
* Self
