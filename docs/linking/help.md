# Semantic Calendaring - Linking: Help

A link to context-sensitive help.

## Knowledge Base

An important feature in any organization is the curation of knowledge about processes and
tools used for everyday operations. This includes being able to provide references to the
relevant information at the right time and place.

Adding help LINKs to components provides a way to directly reference the relevant documentation
that may extend beyond that captured in the referencing component. 

For example, you may compose an action component for a security assessment of an 
in-house application, but rather than list all the requirements of such an assessment verbatim
in the component, a help link can be used to provide extended information regarding how to
complete the action.

## Examples
