# iCal4j Template - Agile: Retrospective

A Backlog represents a group of work items that may be associated with zero or more Sprints.

A Retrospective is a special kind of [Meeting](groupware.md#meeting) [Agenda](groupware.md#agenda) that aims to
reflect on current progress and practices to identify what works and what doesn't. As with a regular Agenda, any
points not discussed may be carried over to the next Retrospective Meeting.
