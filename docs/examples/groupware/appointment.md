# iCal4j Template - Groupware: Appointment

An Appointment is similar to a Meeting but is more of an open invitation to recipients. It is used to publish
events to either a broad or narrow audience, and specifically doesn't cater for RSVPs or Attendance tracking.
An Appointment may still have an associated Agenda for planning, but typically wouldn't include follow-up Actions.
