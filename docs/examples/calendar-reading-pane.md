# SemCal Examples - Calendar Reading Pane

With an expectation of rich content calendaring software can adopt a reading pane layout.

## Overview

Many content aggregation tools, such as email and feed readers, have evolved their user interface (UI)
with an assumption of rich content (typically HTML). By adopting a similar assumption, SemCal clients
may consider the addition of a reading pane layout, with either a split-vertical or three-column
configuration.

Such a configuration would be more suitable for an agenda view rather than a calendar week/month layout
as is often the default currently.

Examples of how a calendar user may benefit from a reading pane include:

* Utility bills can now be rendered directly in the calendar (i.e. at the specified due date), including
usage and payment details.
* Travel information such as flights can be shown in the calendar with up-to-date information on delays
and checkin details
* Meeting details including online and conferencing facilities, attendees and affiliations can all be
displayed in the reading pane
