# iCal4j Template - Budget: Expense

An Expense instance outlines the realised funding spend that is ultimately offset by Funding instances. Ideally the
total of all Expenses will not exceed the total Funding available. This can be mitigated by establishing an Approval
workflow that ensures agreed Funding is available prior to Expense fulfilment.
